## My process
I used this challenge to practice my CSS Grid skills along with Flexbox. I just recently learned how to use grid and found this challenge to be very helpful in implementing what I learned.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I was able to continue to apply my learnings about a mobile-first approach to this design. I have really liked this approach, as it seems to help lessen the amount of media quiries that I need to use in order to get the website looking responsive and meeting design specifications. It was also fun to implement flexbox in conjunction with the grid and see how the two work nicely together. Specifically, I used grid to layout the design, and then used flexbox to design the sections holding the information about the cars.

### Useful resources

- [Wes Bos CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) - I thought this was a great resource to learn about CSS Grid.
